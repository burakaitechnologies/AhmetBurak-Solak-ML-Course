# Lab 10: Course Recap

For Lab 10, I completed the notebook to recap and apply the fundamental machine learning concepts from Modules 1-10 using the Titanic dataset. The lab involved performing an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preparation, training and evaluating classification models, and interpreting advanced metrics like Precision, Recall, F1, and ROC/AUC. I also answered reflective questions within the notebook to demonstrate my understanding of the concepts.

I have included both the PDF and the .ipynb files for this lab. The PDF file contains all executed cells, outputs, and answers to the knowledge check questions. Additionally, the .ipynb file is provided as an alternative in case there are any issues with the PDF.

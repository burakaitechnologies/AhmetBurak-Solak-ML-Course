# Assignment 1: Getting Started with GitHub

For Assignment 1, I learned how to use GitHub by creating my first repository. I made a GitHub account and set up a repository called `ITAI_ML_FirstRepo_AhmetBurakSolak`. In this repository, I uploaded a simple text file to practice. After completing the assignment, I submitted the repository link for grading. Once the assignment was graded, I deleted the repository since it was only a test. A screenshot of the repository was saved as proof of my work.

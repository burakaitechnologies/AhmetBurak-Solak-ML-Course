# Assignment 4: Google Colab EDA

For this assignment, we explored a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) script using Google Colab. The task involved analyzing a dataset and understanding how the code works. Here is my submission:

Dell sells the most laptops, which means they are the biggest company in this market. Apple is different. They only sell ultrabooks with Intel CPUs and their own Mac OS operating sistem. This shows how Apple is a closed system.

The data shows a big difference between operating systems. Windows is on more than 1000 laptops, while Mac OS is only on about 60. This shows that Windows is much more common in the laptop market.

The price data is interesting. The amount of RAM has the biggest effect on price. Laptops with more RAM are more expensive. On the other hand, a hard disk drive (HDD) has a negative effect on price. This means laptops with HDDs are usually cheaper because newer, more expensive laptops use solid-state drives (SSDs). Having a touchscreen does not change the price very much. This means it is a small feature, not a main reason for a high price.

The data also shows which companies are important. Android laptobs and laptobs with Samsung CPUs were removed because there were so few of them. This proves that Intel and AMD are the most important companies for laptop CPUs. Many small companies were put into a group called "others." This shows that a few big companies control the laptop market.

In short, the data confirms what we expect: more RAM and SSD storage make a laptop more expensive. Cheaper laptops often have traditional hard drives.
